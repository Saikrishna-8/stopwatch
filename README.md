"# stopwatch" 
The stopwatch that I have built is a simple web application that allows users to start, stop and reset a timer that counts elapsed time in hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds. The stopwatch uses vanilla JavaScript for all functionality and CSS for styling.

In addition to the stopwatch functionality, the application also includes a countdown timer feature.we can extend it to that Users can enter a countdown time in seconds and it will start automatically after  countdown time.

The application includes a simple but modern user interface that is easy to use and intuitive. The user interface includes a large time display that shows the elapsed time or countdown time, as well as three control buttons for starting, stopping, and resetting the stopwatch or countdown timer. The countdown timer feature includes an input field for setting the countdown time and a separate start button for starting the countdown.

Overall, the stopwatch that I have built is a fully functional and user-friendly web application that can be used for a variety of timing needs.
